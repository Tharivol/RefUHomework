Command line interface (CLI)
These are commands that we type in to the terminal (or shell) directly.
When we get into remote development, we may not have a GUI (graphical user interface) and 
will have to do much of our work using the CLI (command line interface)

Commonly used Commands:
ls                      - list the files in a directory
   ls -l                    - give a long listing for a directory
   ls -a                    - show hidden files
cd {directory}          - change directory
    cd ..                   - move up one directory level
    cd ~                    - move to your home directory
pwd                     - print working directory
mkdir {directory}       - make directory
rmdir {directory}       - remove directory
touch {file}            - modify a file's last modified timestamp, creates the file if it doesn't exist
rm {directory/file}     - remove a file   (ie remove filename)
    rm -r                   - recursive
    rm -f                   - force
cat {file}        - catenate (ie. cat filename)
mv {fromFile} {toFile}  - move a file or directory to another name/location  (ie. move fromFile toFile)
history                 - show a list of commands which were recently run 
sudo {cmd}              - super user do, run the command as the root user


GIT
Git is a source control system that we will use to back up our files and later use
to collaborate with each other.
A repository is a directory that is stored in git and saves history, status, revisions, etc for the directory.

One-time commands (to initialize a repository)
git init                        - create a local repository (not connected to github)
git remote add origin {githubURL}     - connect the local repository to the repository specified by the gitURL
  OR
git clone {githubURL}           - clone/copy the specified github repository to a local repository in the current directory

git status                      - show the status of local files, the local git repository and the remote github repository
git add -A                      - add all files to your local repository (must be IN the repository diretory to add all files in that directory and it's sub-directories)
git commit -m "my comment"      - commits changes to the local repository
git push origin master          - pushes local changes to github
git pull origin master          - pull all changes from github to the local repository

A git repository directory will always have a .git directory inside it.  That is where git stores all of its versioning information and github connection info.
You can remove the .git directory to remove the git repository information while leaving all of the files themselves in place.
NOTE: Don't create a repository in a repository.  It gets confusing later!
The Dec2016-DemoCode repository will contain all lecture notes for the course.  
Please treat this as a read-only repository and only 'pull'  Do not 'push'
Feel free to create your own repository(s) and play with git - add, commit, push, pull, etc.


NPM
Node Package Manager
installed along with node 

npm install -g http-server
- installs the http-server command globally

You can run the 'http-server' command in a directory to have it serve html files
that exist in that directory.
