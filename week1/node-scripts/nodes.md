# Node Scripts

## Node REPL
REPL - Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop

The Node REPL is like a sandbox for you to play around in and write some code.  It works very similarly to the `Console` tab in Chrome Dev tools.

### Running Files
> The way you will use Node most often

To run a NodeJS file, simply create a file with a `.js` extension (remember that Node is just JavaScript!) and write some JavaScript in it.

Once the file is created, in your terminal run the command :
- `node FILENAME.js`
