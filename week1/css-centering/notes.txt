CSS centering


Horizontally centering elements
block elements:
.inner { margin : auto }

inline-block elements:
.outer {text-align: center}
.inner {text-align: initial}



Vertically centering elements


in CSS, most styles are not inherited from parents to children. The exception to this is that font-related styles DO get inherited.
